# VBA-challenge

Background

  I created a VBA script to analyze stock market data. The data is stored inside an Excel workbook that cover 3 years of data from 2014 to 2016. Each year of data is stored within seperate worksheets.

Testing Environment

  I created and ran this script on a Mac (macOS 10.15.7) using Office 356.

Script

The script will loop through all the stocks for a year and output the following
  - Ticker Symbol
  - Yearly change for the year as a whole number and a percent.
  - Total stock volume
  -
